Anime Brawl...the app that wasn't finished in time for presentations!

Unfortunatly I am very disappointed with myself that I did not finish this app in time. The idea and concept was very clever but I think my poor execution to the project and my lack of knowledge and willingness to ask for help held me back. 

I really wanted to challenge myself in terms of trying to get this project functional. I did complete MVP but I certainly chewed more than what I can swallow. Which is disappointing, but I will finish this project.

What is Anime Brawl?
In concept anime brawl was a turn based combat battle game. Based off of pokemon and other typical RPGs. You select a character, you get matched with and fight. You were supposed to have an option of either attack or defend. if you press attack you would have an option of attacking based on 4 moves.

What happened?
The game functionality is way off and no where near where I wanted it to be. I blame this on three things that are all my own fault.

1. Don't chew more than you can swallow.
2. Don't get too cocky.
3. Don't be too stubborn that it's too late to ask for help and guidance.

Half of the project is complete. You are able to select a character. You are able to view their moves, but the battle functionality is not there. I couldn't figure out how to apply damage to a character. 

In the grand scheme of things, this was a huge disappointment for me. I expected a lot more and I simply did not deliver. 
I will finish the project after graduation, but I really wish that I was able to complete it on time to present.
